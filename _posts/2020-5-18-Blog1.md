What do you think being a data scientist is about?  What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

To me, data science exists at the intersection of computer science and statistics. Data scientists must have a firm grasp on statistics but also must know how to handle "big data", machine learning, and computer science in general. These days, I agree with the sentiment that the fields of data science and statistics are starting to largely merge together. The main difference being, someone with a data science background may have more experience with computer science skills, whereas someone with a statistics background may be more well versed in the foundations, theory, and research methods (i.e. surveys). I view myself probably more toward the stasticics side of the spectrum, though I do have experience with handling "big data", machine learning, and other data science related skills. I am looking forward to growing my skills in this course.
