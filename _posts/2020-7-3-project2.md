With this project, again I think the main thing I would do differently is time management. There are so many things that can come up that take a lot of time and can really slow down the process. In my case this time it was the amount of time it took to output all of the individual reports. It took a lot of time, so if there was a mistake and I had to rerun, it took a chunk of time that I couldn't spend continuing to work. It is good to factor in things like this when managing time.

The most difficult part was setting up the automation. That took a lot of trial and error. I am still not entirely sure I did it correctly. I was not able to get it to work properly iterating through the `weekday_is_*` variables, so instead I created a factor variable with the respective days of the week asigned, so that the `params` call iterated through the rows, instead of through the variables.

My biggest takeaway is that automation via RMarkdown and GitHub is seriously awesome, and that also I could definitely still improve my time management on tasks like this. It is important because I do a lot of automation type work in my job. These are definitely skills I will be using on a daily basis.
